## Problem Description

Hossam woke up bored, so he decided to create an interesting array with his friend Hazem.

You are given an array of `n` positive integers  
`a1, a2, ..., an`.

Hossam will choose a number `ai` and Hazem will choose a number `aj`.

Your task is to count the number of index pairs `(i, j)` such that:

- `1 ≤ i, j ≤ n`
- `i ≠ j`
- The absolute difference `|ai − aj|` is equal to the **maximum absolute difference** over all pairs in the array

---

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer `t` — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer `n`
  - The second line contains `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an`

---

## Output Format

- For each test case, print a single integer — the number of valid pairs `(i, j)`.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100000`
- `1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000`
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `100000`

## Sample Input

```
2

6 2 3 8 1

7 2 8 3 2 10

## Output

```
