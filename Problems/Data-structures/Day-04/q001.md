# PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Monocarp had a regular bracket sequence **s** of length **n** (**n** is even).  
He even came up with his own way to calculate its **cost**.

In a regular bracket sequence (RBS), each opening bracket is paired with the corresponding closing bracket.  
The **cost** of an RBS is defined as the **sum of distances** between all corresponding bracket pairs.

For example, consider the RBS **(())()**. It has three bracket pairs:

- Brackets at positions **1** and **4** → distance = **4 − 1 = 3**
- Brackets at positions **2** and **3** → distance = **3 − 2 = 1**
- Brackets at positions **5** and **6** → distance = **6 − 5 = 1**

So, the total cost is **3 + 1 + 1 = 5**.

---

Unfortunately, due to data corruption, Monocarp lost all characters on **odd positions**  
(**s₁, s₃, …, sₙ₋₁**). Only characters on **even positions** remain.

For example:
(())() → _(_)_)


Monocarp wants to restore the string by placing brackets on odd positions such that:

- The resulting string is a **valid regular bracket sequence**
- The **total cost is minimized**

It is guaranteed that at least one valid restoration exists.

---

## Input

The first line contains a single integer **t**  
(**1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**) — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- The first line contains an even integer **n**  
  (**2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10⁵**) — the length of the string.
- The second line contains a string **s** of length **n**, where:
  - Characters at **odd positions** are `'_'`
  - Characters at **even positions** are `'('` or `')'`

Additional constraints:

- The sum of **n** over all test cases does not exceed **2 · 10⁵**
- The string can always be restored to at least one valid RBS

---

## Output

For each test case, print a single integer —  
the **minimum possible cost** of a regular bracket sequence that can be obtained.
