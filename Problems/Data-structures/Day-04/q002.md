## 📘 Problem Statement

Allyn is playing a new strategy game called **Accumulator Apex**.

In this game:

- Allyn is given an initial integer value **x**, called the **accumulator**.
- There are **k** lists of integers.
- Allyn can make multiple turns.

### 🔁 Game Rules

On each turn, Allyn can:

- Choose **any non-empty list**
- Withdraw the **leftmost element** from that list
- Add it to the accumulator **x**, **only if** the resulting value of **x** is **non-negative**

Allyn may **end the game at any moment**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Find the **maximum possible value** of the accumulator **x** that Allyn can achieve.

---

### 📥 Input Format

The first line contains two integers **x** and **k**:

- $0 \le x \le 10^9$
- $1 \le k \le 10^5$

The next **k** lines describe the lists:

- Each line starts with an integer **lᵢ** $(lᵢ \ge 1)$
- Followed by **lᵢ** integers representing the list elements (from left to right)

---

### 🔢 Constraints

- Each element in the lists satisfies:  
  $|a_{ij}| \le 10^9$

- The total number of elements across all lists does not exceed:  
  $10^5$

---

## 📤 Output Format

- Print a single integer — the **maximum possible value** of the accumulator **x**.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Elements must be taken **from the left end** of a list.
- You can switch between lists at any time.
- You are **not required** to consume all elements.
- The accumulator value must **never become negative**.

---

## ✅ Example (Conceptual)

If at some point adding an element makes the accumulator negative, that move is **not allowed**.

The optimal strategy may involve:
- Taking positive elements early
- Skipping lists that block progress due to large negative prefixes
